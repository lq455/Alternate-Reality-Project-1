## Premise

### Background Story

It is a summer night. Your friends dare you to spend two hours in the midnight alone in the graveyard near the town. It is an old discarded place burying people that no one knows much about. Not many have visited there too. There are rumors saying that it is a cursed place, and that people have gone missing after going there at night before. But you are not afraid. What a perfect opportunity for you to prove your courage. What could go wrong?
### Concept of this place

This is a cursed place. Here lies the body of the most monstrous murderer along with his victims. Even when he is gone, his desirefor blood does not fade away. He lies under the ground and awaits his next prey.

## Reflection

### Work Progress

This project is a great opportunity for me to practice the skills I learned in the previous weeks to create a scene that can tell a storyline. I first used the Probuilder to build the terrain of the scene. I started with a plane and then used the polybrush to create the landscape and painted the grass and trees.

I then found and downloaded the asset models including graves, streetlights, bloody zombie hands, and eye balls from the Unity asset store and the Sketchfab. I arranged them properly to create a scene of a horrifying graveyard. I followed Vincent McCurley's guide and designed most of the animations at the position in the front where people are more likely to experience to the fullest. After that, I experimented with the different attributes of the light. I first tried changing the color of the light and created animations to create the atmosphere of horror. Then I manipulated the intensity of the lights to create animations for a flicking light. I then began to look for differet sound effects online. It took me quite much time to combine the sound properly with the animation, such as the combination of the glasses breaking and the lights went out. Finally, I added the animations of the eyeball moving as if it was looking for someone and the zombie hands trembling as if they want to grasp something to add to the dynamic of the scene.

### Challenges

I spent quite a lot of time trying to make the sound effects synchronize with the animations. It turned out to be a lot more difficult than I thought as the length of most sound effects I found online is quite different from the length of my original animation so I had to readjust a lot. In addition, the light setting is also quite tricky as one one hand I want to create the vibe of horror so I want to use dimming lights. But on the other hand, I also don't wnat the whole scene to be too dark that the player cannot see any scene. Finding the balance between this is quite challenging for me, but it is also very exciting to explore along the way and ask others to test out the result.

### Final Thoughts

The process of building this project helps me a lot to review the skills of Unity and virtual scene design that I have learned in class so far. Due to the time limitation, I haven't created as many animations as I previously planned. Instead I focused on making the animations fit better with the scene and the storytelling that I want to convey through the scene. In the process of doing so, I develop a better understanding of how to use certain arrangements of objects, lights and sounds to create the sense of a horror story. While there is not any character in the scene, with the combination of the animated objects, lights and sound effects, the scene can still convey a story of horror. I really look forward to learning how to implement the element of interaction in the project in the future.
